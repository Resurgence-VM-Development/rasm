# `rasm++`: The Rust rewrite of rasm

This project aims to rewrite the rasm assembler in Rust but with additional features to make it a proper language. Planned features include:
- [] Plugging constants directly instead of being forced to use the constants section and using `const[]`
- [] Changes in how local, global, and const registers are indexed ([] instead of ())
- [] Changes in instruction names to make reading easier (ex. stack_push instead of STACKPUSH)
- [] Explicit bytecode version option for programmers

Right now we're looking for contributors to help finish the rewrite and implement these features! Join the discord server if you're interested!: https://discord.gg/KQvBbJk8h6
